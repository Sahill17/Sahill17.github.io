Maps in Golang are similar to objects we have in JavaScript, dictionaries we have in Python, and hashes we have in Ruby.\nTo create a map, let\u0026rsquo;s use the built-in make.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { Ages := make(map[string]int) fmt.Println(Ages) Ages[\u0026#34;Key\u0026#34;] = 0 Ages[\u0026#34;Sahil\u0026#34;] = 22 Ages[\u0026#34;Dev\u0026#34;] = 23 fmt.Println(Ages) } % go run maps.go map[] map[Dev:23 Key:0 Sahil:22] In Go, maps are inherently unordered — this means that when we print a map, the order of the key-value pairs is not guaranteed and may vary between runs or operations.\nIf order matters to us, we can use a slice of keys or a struct with a slice.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { Ages := make(map[string]int) fmt.Println(Ages) keys := []string{\u0026#34;Key\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Sahil\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Dev\u0026#34;} Ages[\u0026#34;Sahil\u0026#34;], Ages[\u0026#34;Dev\u0026#34;] = 22, 23 for _, k := range keys { fmt.Println(k, Ages[k]) } } % go run maps.go map[] Key 0 Sahil 22 Dev 23 Let\u0026rsquo;s mutate maps Let\u0026rsquo;s create a map without using make, and mutate it. We already know how to insert an element or assign a value to a key — check the above example.\nCheck out the example below with some basic mutations.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { Movies := map[string]string{ \u0026#34;La La Land\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Damien Chazelle\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Whiplash\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Damien Chazelle\u0026#34;, } // Add a Movie Movies[\u0026#34;Inglourious basterds\u0026#34;] = \u0026#34;Quentin Tarantino\u0026#34; Movies[\u0026#34;Fight Club\u0026#34;] = \u0026#34;David Fincher\u0026#34; // Ohh shit, First rule delete(Movies, \u0026#34;Fight Club\u0026#34;) // Get director\u0026#39;s name fmt.Println(Movies[\u0026#34;La La Land\u0026#34;]) // Do we have any Tarantino Movie? director, ok := Movies[\u0026#34;Inglourious basterds\u0026#34;] fmt.Println(director, \u0026#34;made Inglourious basterds?\u0026#34;, ok) } % go run maps.go Damien Chazelle Quentin Tarantino made Inglourious basterds? true In the above example, we also checked if a key exists or not. If the key is in the map, then the second parameter will be true, otherwise it\u0026rsquo;ll be false.\nLike slices, maps are also passed by reference into functions. This means that when a map is passed into a function we write, we can make changes to the original — we don\u0026rsquo;t have a copy.\nAttempting to get a value from a map where the key doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist returns the zero value of its type, but our program doesn\u0026rsquo;t panic.\nNested maps? Like JSON? Yep, we can totally do that. Just like in JSON, Go allows us to have maps within maps.

Here we will be looking into Arrays and Slices.\nWe already know what arrays are, but let’s just quickly reexamine what their definition is.\nAn array is a linear data structure where all the elements are arranged sequentially. Stored at contiguous memory locations.\nIs the array always of a fixed size? At core, arrays are fixed size only, but most of the languages provide dynamic-sized arrays using underlined fixed arrays. For example, Java has ArrayList, and Python has lists.\nArrays in Go In Go we have fixed-size arrays. Let’s define an array.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { // var myInts [10]int primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} fmt.Println(primes) } % go run arrays.go [2 3 5 7 11 13] Slices Slices are like references to arrays. A slice does not store any data; it just describes a section of an underlying array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.\nA slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound separated by a colon. From which the lower side includes the first element and the higher side excludes the last element.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { a := [5]int{4, 6, 2, 7, 8} var slice []int = a[1:3] fmt.Println(slice) } % go run slices.go [6 2] Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { a := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} s1 := a[:3] s2 := a[3:] fmt.Println(s1, s2) s2[0] = 0 fmt.Println(s1, s2) fmt.Println(a) } go run slices.go [1 2 3] [4 5] [1 2 3] [0 5] [1 2 3 0 5] A slice has both a length and a capacity. The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains. The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.\nYou can extend a slice\u0026rsquo;s length by re-slicing it, provided it has sufficient capacity.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { a := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} s1 := a[:2] fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;For a len=%d cap=%d\\n\u0026#34;, len(a), cap(a)) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;For s1 len=%d cap=%d\\n\u0026#34;, len(s1), cap(s1)) s1 = a[:4] fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Extended len=%d cap=%d\\n\u0026#34;, len(s1), cap(s1)) s1 = a[3:] fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Dropped len=%d cap=%d\\n\u0026#34;, len(s1), cap(s1)) } % go run slices.go For a len=5 cap=5 For s1 len=2 cap=5 Extended len=4 cap=5 Dropped len=2 cap=2 Nil Slices The zero value of a slice is nil. A nil slice has a length and capacity of 0 and has no underlying array.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { var s []int fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) if s == nil { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;nil!\u0026#34;) } } go run .\\nil_slice.go [] 0 0 nil! Create slices with Make We can create slices with built-in make function. and it’s a way to create dynamically-sized arrays. When we use the make function to create a slice, it allocates the zeroed value array and returns a slice that refers to that zeroed value array.\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { a := make([]int, 3) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%v len=%d cap=%d \\n\u0026#34;, a, len(a), cap(a)) // We can specify capacity in third parameter b := make([]string, 3, 5) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%v len=%d cap=%d\u0026#34;, b, len(b), cap(b)) } go run .\\make_slice.go [0 0 0] len=3 cap=3 [ ] len=3 cap=5 If we want to create a slice with a specific set of values, we can use a slice literal.\nmySlice := []string {\u0026#34;I\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;love\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Golang\u0026#34;} Appending new elements to a slice Go also provides a built-in append function to append new elements to a slice. If array is too small to fit all the given values a bigger array gets allocated and slice will point to the newly allocated array.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; ) func main() { var a []int fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%v \\n\u0026#34;, a) // Slice grows as needed a = append(a, 1) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%v \\n\u0026#34;, a) // We can add multiple values a = append(a, 2, 3, 4) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%v \\n\u0026#34;, a) } go run .\\slice_append.go [] [1] [1 2 3 4] I guess we will wrap it up here.

Defer statement defer keyword allows a function to be executed automatically just before its enclosing function returns.

If you plan to share your code with others, this name needs to be a place where Go Tools can find and download your code.\nWe will use example/hello\n$ go mod init example/hello go: creating new go.mod: module example/hello Create a file, hello.go in which to write your code\nPaste the following code into your hello.go file and save the file\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) } Package: a package is a way to group functions, and it\u0026rsquo;s made up of all the files in the same directory\nfmt package: This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go. which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console.\nmain function: A main function to print a message to the console. A main function executes by default when you run the main package.\nRun the code to say Hello to the world % go run . Hello, World! Congratulations! We have successfully said hello to the world.\nPackages \u0026amp; Imports Every Go program is made up of packages. Programs start running in package main.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;math/rand\u0026#34; ) func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;My favorite number is\u0026#34;, rand.Intn(10)) } This program uses packages with import paths \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;math/rand\u0026quot;.\nBy convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the \u0026quot;math/rand\u0026quot; package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.\nThis code groups the imports into a parenthesized, \u0026ldquo;factored\u0026rdquo; import statement.\nYou can also write multiple import statements, like:\nimport \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; import \u0026#34;math/rand\u0026#34; But it is good style to use the factored import statement.\nExported names In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pi, is exported from the math package.\nWhen importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any \u0026ldquo;unexported\u0026rdquo; names are not accessible from outside the package.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;math\u0026#34; ) func main() { fmt.Println(math.pi) } There is an error in the above code. To fix the error, rename the math.pi to math.Pi.\nSee you soon!

Go, commonly referred to as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was first released in 2009, and since then, it has gained immense popularity among developers for its simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency support.\nReasons to learn Golang? Faster Compiled languages are much faster than interpreted languages, and Go is no exception. Go is generally faster and more lightweight than interpreted or VM powered languages like\nPython\nJavaScript\nPHP\nRuby\nJava\nHowever, in terms of execution speed, Go does lay behind some other compiled languages, like\nC\nC++\nRust\nMemory Management Go is a bit slower due to it\u0026rsquo;s automated memory management, also known as the Go Runtime . A slightly slower speed is the price we pay for memory safety and simple syntax.\nGo programs are fairly lightweight. Each program includes a small amount of \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; code that\u0026rsquo;s included in the executable binary. This extra code is called the Go Runtime. One of the purposes of Go Runtime is to cleanup unused memory at runtime.\nIn other words, the Go compiler includes a small amount of extra logic in every Go program to make it easier for the developers to write code that\u0026rsquo;s memory efficient.\nEasy Multitasking In Go, you can effortlessly handle concurrent tasks using Go Routines. Picture running a web server that serves requests while simultaneously processing data in the background. Go Routines Make it smooth and efficient, allowing your programs to multitask seamlessly without getting bogged down.\nWorks Everywhere Go\u0026rsquo;s cross-platform support means your code runs smoothly on various operating systems and architectures without modification. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re deploying your application on a Linux server, a Windows machine, or a Raspberry Pi, Go\u0026rsquo;s portability ensures consistent behaviour across different environments, simplifying deployment and maintenance tasks.\nIn-Demand and High-Paying Job Opportunities In 2024, Go (Golang) developers will continue to be highly sought after, with companies of all sizes relying on Go for building scalable and efficient software solutions. From tech giants like Google and Uber to startups and enterprises, the demand for Go expertise remains strong. Projects in cloud-native development, microservices architecture, and backend systems often utilize Go, offering exciting career opportunities for developers skilled in the language. With its integral role in modern software development, mastering Go opens doors to high-paying positions and rewarding career paths.\nHow do I get started with Golang? There are many resources available online to help you get started. The official Golang website provides a comprehensive tutorial for beginners, as well as documentation for more advanced topics.\nBut if you want to learn Golang with me, then you can join me on this journey. I\u0026rsquo;ll be learning Golang with you.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/why-learn-go/","summary":"Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google.","title":"Why Learn Go(Golang)?"}]
